Instructions for Codex working in this repository.

## Project Context
- Root: `c:\wamp64\www\inve-app`
- Stack: PHP (Wamp), HTML/CSS/JS
- Primary app pages live in `pagesweb_cn/`

## Workflow
- Prefer small, focused changes; explain intent briefly.
- When editing PHP, preserve existing conventions and mixed HTML/PHP style.
- Avoid unrelated refactors unless asked.

## File Handling
- Use ASCII by default; only add Unicode when the file already contains it.
- Keep changes localized to the requested files.

## Verification
- If tests exist, ask before running them.
